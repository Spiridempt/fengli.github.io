<p>
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study to investigate the relationship between programming languages and bug-handling effort. 600 projects (70,816,938 SLOC, 3,096,009 commits) of 10 programming languages in GitHub were gathered and analyzed. There are several interesting results:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Different programming languages have different bug-handling effort. For example, Java tends to require more line/file modification than other languages but less bug-handling time, while Ruby tends to require more bug-handling time as well as more line/file modification.</li>
<li>Weak/dynamic languages tend to need more time than strong/static languages, while static languages tend to need more absolute line/file modification.</li>
<li>A toy predictive model is proposed to proof that the consideration of programming languages can improve the effectiveness when predicting bug-handling effort.</li>
</ul>
