Welcome! 

This is the readme for the PartII data analysis in paper "How Does Bug-Handling Effort Differ Among Different Programming Languages?"

Package "data-for-analysis" contains all the data we used for the final-step analysis. Each row contains the basic information (project name, language, SLOC, age, and so on) as well as the bug-handling effort of each project.

Package "scripts" contains all the R scripts we used for multiple-regerssion, Scott-Knott analysis, and graph plotting. These scripts need to be run on ggplot.

Inside all the scripts, please change the path accordingly:
1. Change the CSVPATH into the path of folder "data-for-analysis", which contains the CSV files
2. Change the RESULT-PDF-PATH into the result path to put generated PDF files

To get the violin plots (Figure 2 in the paper):
Script: violin-log.R

To get the median-value analysis plots (Figure 3):
Notes:The median values of each language are stored in path "data-for-analysis/medianvalues/"
Script: median-analysis.R

To get the Scott-Knott test results (Figure 4):
Script: Scottknott.R

To get the multiple-regression results (Table 2 and Table 3):
Script: multiple-regression.R

To get the impact of domain (Table 5):
Script: domain.R
